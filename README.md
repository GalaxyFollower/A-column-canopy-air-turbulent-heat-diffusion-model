# A-column-canopy-air-turbulent-heat-diffusion-model

The flux tower data is stored in '*.mat'. "Main.m" shows how to call the model to calculate turbulent heat flux for 28 flux tower. 

This work advances the SEBS model to be applicable for typical land covers of the globe, and helps us to generate surface heat flux maps over the global land area by remote sensing technique,
